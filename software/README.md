These are some examples of Apple I software, in monitor format.

To use, start the emulator, which will bring you to the monitor prompt. Then,
click F1 and choose a file. These (text) files will be pasted into the Apple 1,
which will enter them as code.

* [a1basic.mon](a1basic.mon): Apple Integer BASIC
* [fig6502.mon](fig6502.mon): fig-Forth 1.0 originally for OSI, but with minor
  modifications to work on the Apple 1
